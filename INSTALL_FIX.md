# ðŸ”§ NPM INSTALL FIX

**Issue:** npm install was saying "up to date" but `firebase-admin` was not actually installed.

**Root Cause:** package-lock.json was out of sync with package.json

**Solution Applied:**
1. Deleted package-lock.json
2. Deleted node_modules folder
3. Running fresh `npm install`

**Status:** Installing now... (this takes ~2-3 minutes)

**After install completes:**
```bash
cd ../..
firebase deploy --only apphosting:aaypnfp --project adopt-a-young-parent
```

**What to verify:**
- `node_modules/firebase-admin` folder exists
- package-lock.json is regenerated
- Build succeeds
